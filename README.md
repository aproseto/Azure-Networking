# Confirguring Secure Workload Access with Azure Networking

## Objective

The Secure Workload Access Azure project is a coursera-led project by Microsoft to teach about setting up Azure Networking Services. I will be learning how to secure resources within the Azure Cloud environment, through isolation and segmentation, and protect Virtual Machines through Azure Firewalls.

### Skills Learned

- Creating a Microsoft Azure Lab Environment.
- Configuring Virtual Networks and Network Routing.
- Configuring Network Security Groups (NSGs).
- Configuring Azure Firewall Create DNS Zones.
- Configuring DNS Settings.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure to set up Virutal Machines and create NSGs, Firewalls, and DNS Settings.
